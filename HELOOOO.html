<p> My <em>favorite</em> <strong>color</strong> is <em><strong>Orange</em></strong>
<br> 
</p>
<p id="wert">The color orange is a combination of red and yellow. It is a bright and warm color. It represents fire, sun, fun, warmth and tropical surroundings. Orange is considered a fun, light color with appetizing and delicious qualities. It also increases the oxygen supply to the brain and stimulates mental activity. The color orange is highly accepted among young people.

<h3><strong><em>Orange is the color of joy and creativity. Orange promotes a sense of general wellness and emotional energy that should be shared, such as compassion, passion, and warmth. Orange will help a person recover from disappointments, a wounded heart, or a blow to oneï¿½s pride.While orange does stimulate the appetite, it is a common color found in citrus fruit and is often associated with Vitamin C and a healthy diet. Orange is a popular color in restaurants to encourage the feeling of hunger and contentment.</em></strong>
